	Mastermind is a code-breaking game in which, typically, two players take turns placing pegs in rows of holes on a decoding board, trying to guess a hidden pattern of pegs.

	In this single-player digital version, a hidden pattern of colored pegs will be created at the start of the game. You have six rows to guess the pattern by clicking the colored buttons at the bottom to put a peg of the corresponding color in the next slot of the current row. After you click the Confirm button, the computer will check your guess and place a series of key pegs to the right of your code pegs. Every white peg represents you see to the right represents a 'blow', or peg that has the correct color but is in the incorrect position. A black peg represents a 'hit', or a correct-colored peg in the correct position. If you guess the pattern correctly, or if you reach the last row without guessing the pattern correctly, the hidden pattern will be revealed, and the game will end.

	You can start a new game by clicking the New Game button under the Game menu.

	You can also change various settings, such as whether or not to include repeating colors in the pattern, the number of slots in the pattern, and the number of colors. If this is your first time playing, I would recommend you start out with the default settings, with no repeating colors, 4 slots, and 6 colors. If you want more of a challenge, try turning repeating colors off. If you want to up the difficulty even more, try increasing the number of colors.
